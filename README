Step1:
  Install all the requirements for the project (django,django_rest framework and all.)
Step2:
  Create a project and along with its inner applications(TestAPI which is for creating API ,Test APP which is for consuming the API service)
Step3:
   Did all the migrations and create superUser along with its username and password..
Step4:
   Firstly developed TestAPI which is for  creating the API service along with its required logic and run the server and tried with
   client code,

     import requests
     import json
     data1={'a':10,'b':20}
     Base_url='http://localhost:8000/'
     endpoint='api/'
     r=requests.get(Base_url+endpoint,data=json.dumps(data1))
     print(r.json())

Step5:
   After completion of the API service just implemented a TestAPP application for consuming the service of the RestAPI by using the
   UI technologies.
Step6:
   Given correct navigation to TestAPI to TestAPP and update all the configuration accourding to settings.py file.
